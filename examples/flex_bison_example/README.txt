This flex/bison example is provided to you as a starting point for your
assignment. You are free to use its code in your project.

This example implements a simple calculator. You can use the '-l' flag to
list all the tokens found in the source file, and the '-p' flag (or no flag)
to parse the file and to compute the result.

Also, if you have any suggestions for improvements, please let us know.

To create the executable 'calc', just use 'make'.

To use it, type './calc -l <source_file>' to only do the lexical analysis or
type './calc <source_file>' or './calc -p <source_file>' to also do the syntax
analysis and to compute the result.

Some small example files are provided in the 'examples' folder.
