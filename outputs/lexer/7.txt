Your VSOP compiler seems to have been built successfully. We will now
proceed to some basic conformance tests of your lexer.

Please note that the tests are not exhaustive, and full success on the
tests does not mean your lexer is perfect. You are responsible for
testing your lexer. Write your own tests!

If a test fails, this script will output the corresponding VSOP code,
the expected output, and your compiler output. We will only report this
information for the first few failed tests, however.

Note that as the e-mail transfer is destroying many non-printable
characters, the files are printed with 'cat -v', i.e. "\r" is replaced
by "^M", "\f" by "^L", etc.

As you were free to design your own error messages, and we did not specified
what you should do after a lexical error (e.g. stop, continue just after the
faulty token, try to resynchronize on a likely token start, etc.), this script
will only check error messages up to the "<FILENAME>:<LINE>:<COL>: lexical
error", and will stop both error and output processing after the first error.

If you think the expected output is wrong, and your compiler is correct, double
check the VSOP manual and the wording. If, after that, you still think you are
correct and we are wrong, report it to the teaching assistant.

If the script crashes, report it to the teaching assistant.
